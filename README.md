# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

Description:   This is a basic scheduler.  When you open the link it will give you the current day.  Work day is from 8AM-5PM.  Now the schedule will have three different colors.  There is grey that will appear after that hour is up.  Red is for the current Hour and Green is for future hours.  After you input you need to click the save button after that hour to save to local storage.  If you change the date on your computer to the next day you will see a new calendar and it should be all green.
